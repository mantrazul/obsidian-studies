### What is Character Encoding in HTML

Character encoding is basically a **mapping technique to define text and bytes** separately within HTML documents. To understand character encoding, authors must understand what characters are.

#### What are Characters in Coding Languages

**Characters denote** alphabetic letters, punctuation, special characters, and some other elements that make up the entire content. The information is stored in a computer as a sequence of bytes in numeric values. A single character can sometimes be represented by more than one byte.

Text, images, graphics, video, data compilations, and all other forms of information that appear to the website reader are **made up of "characters"** in a web page content.

> [!NOTE]
> What key was used to encode the text determines how the sequence of bytes is converted to characters. In this case, the key is referred to as character encoding.
