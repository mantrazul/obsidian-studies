Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.

Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets `<>`. For example, an opening paragraph tag looks like this: `<p>`.

Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: `</p>`.

A full paragraph element looks like this:

```html
<p>some text content</p>
```

- `<p>` is the opening tag.
- `some text content` represents content wrapped within the opening and closing tags.
- `</p>` is the closing tag.
- 
These elements often look like this: `<br />` or `<img/>`, but some can also be used without the closing forward slash such as `<br>` or `<img>`.
