- Machine only understand binary. Where humans write **source code**, a list of instructions for the computer that is human readable, machines only understand what we can call **machine code**. This machine code is a pattern of ones and zeros that produces a desired effect.
- We can convert **source code** into `machine code` using a very special piece of software called a **compiler**.

##### Three Axis of Code

Code can be evaluated upon three axes:

1. **Correctness**: refers to "does the code run as intended?"
2. **Design**: refers to "how well is the code designed?"
3. **Style**: refers to "how aesthetically pleasing and consistent is the code?"

### Hello World

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("hello, workd\n");
}
```
