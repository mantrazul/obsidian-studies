### Basic syntax

> A `<div>` is one of the basic HTML elements. It is simply an empty container. In general, it is best to use other tags such as `<h1>` or `<p>` for content in your projects, but as we learn more about CSS you’ll find that there are many cases where the thing you need is just a container for other elements. Many of our exercises use plain`<div>`s for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements.

### Selectors

Selectors simply refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they're what is actually being "selected" for each rule.

#### Universal selector

Selects elements of any type, hence the name "universal".

```css
* {
	color: purple;
}
```

#### Type selectors

A type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div>Hello, World!</div>
<div>Hello again!</div>
<p>Hi...</p>
<div>Okay, bye.</div>
```

```css
/* styles.css */

div {
  color: white;
}
```

#### Class selectors

Class selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. Here’s how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>
```

```css
/* styles.css */

.alert-text {
  color: red;
}
```

Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as `class="alert-text severe-alert"`. Since **white-space** is used to **separate class** names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.

#### ID selectors

ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have **one** ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any white space:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>
```

```css
/* styles.css */

#title {
  background-color: red;
}
```

#### The grouping selector

What if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?

```css
.read,
.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

.read {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  /* several unique declarations */
}
```

#### Chaining selectors

Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. Let’s say we had the following HTML:

```html
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
```

We have two elements with the `subsection` class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has `header` as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:

```css
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}
```

What `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` _and_ `header` classes. Notice how there isn’t any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one [type selector](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-intro-to-css#type-selectors).

This can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:

```html
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">
    This is where a preview for a post might go.
  </p>
</div>
```

You can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:

```css
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}

.subsection#preview {
  color: blue;
}
```

In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like `div` and `p` would give us the selector `divp`, which wouldn’t work since the selector would try to find a literal `<divp>` element, which doesn’t exist.

#### Descendant combinator

Combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we’re going to only show you the **descendant combinator**, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc) that matches the previous selector.

So something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is that `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside `ancestor`, regardless of how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="ancestor">
  <!-- A -->
  <div class="contents">
    <!-- B -->
    <div class="contents"><!-- C --></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="contents"></div>
<!-- D -->
```

```css
/* styles.css */

.ancestor .contents {
  /* some declarations */
}
```

In the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (B and C) would be selected, but that last element (D) wouldn’t be. Was your guess correct?

There’s really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.
