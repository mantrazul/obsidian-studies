There are eight **Data Types**. Seven of them are called **primitive** because their value contain only a single thing.

In contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more comple entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else.

An object can be created with figure brackets `{...}` with an optional list of *properties*.

We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. It's easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.

#### Object Literal

```javascript
let user = new Object();
let user = {};
```


### Literals and properties

We can put some properties into `{...}` as "key:value"
